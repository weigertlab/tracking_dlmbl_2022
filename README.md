# tracking_dlmbl_2022

## Setup  (tbd)


## Internal agenda: (will be removed)

1. Tracking by detection and simple frame by frame matching: 
    - Overview of dataset (breast tumor dataset)
    - Detection via stardist, vary scale, show distances etc 
    - Simple iou based frame by Frame tracking (hungarian matching)
        * metrics
        * custom features with scikit image
  
2. Linear Assignment (LAP) tracking
    - LAP tracking, build cost matrices M (linking), N (GAP/division) 
    - LAP++ with missed division 
    - Application workflow with Trackmate 
  

3. Advanced topics and linear optimization
    - Network flow, how to set up, how to solve with networkx 
    - Full ILP (lineajea, cvxopt)
